===========================================
  You are using EDMC algorithm.

===== Init heuristics! =====

Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 5.48s, with 354939 rules fired and 41117 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_34" failed.

State Space Explored:

	102925 states, 365342 rules fired in 5.57s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
