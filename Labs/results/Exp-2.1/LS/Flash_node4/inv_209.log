===== Startstates are generated! =====

Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 3.07s, with 147958 rules fired and 73865 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 3.49s, with 298772 rules fired and 147585 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 3.91s, with 447070 rules fired and 221658 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 4.35s, with 597394 rules fired and 295847 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_209" failed.

State Space Explored:

	448774 states, 670149 rules fired in 4.56s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
