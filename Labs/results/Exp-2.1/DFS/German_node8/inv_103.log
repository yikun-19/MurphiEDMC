Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0
Finite-state Concurrent System Verifier.

Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 is based on various versions of Murphi.
Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 :
Copyright (C) 2009-2012 by Sapienza University of Rome.
Murphi release 3.1 :
Copyright (C) 1992 - 1999 by the Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior University.

==========================================================================

Protocol: ./protocols/exec/German_node8/German_node8_inv103

Algorithm:
	Verification by depth first search.
	with symmetry algorithm 3 -- Heuristic Small Memory Normalization
	with permutation trial limit 10.

Memory usage:

	* The size of each state is 680 bits (rounded up to 88 bytes).
	* The memory allocated for the hash table and state queue is
	  10485 Mbytes.
	  With two words of overhead per state, the maximum size of
	  the state space is 86802673 states.
	   * Use option "-k" or "-m" to increase this, if necessary.
	* Capacity in queue for depth-first search: 8680267 states.
	   * Change the constant gPercentActiveStates in mu_prolog.inc
	     to increase this, if necessary.

Warning: No trace will not be printed in the case of protocol errors!
         Check the options if you want to have error traces.

Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 2.81s, with 162945 rules fired and 68758 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 3.05s, with 327939 rules fired and 135927 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 3.31s, with 494319 rules fired and 202070 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 3.58s, with 658984 rules fired and 269521 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 3.88s, with 826204 rules fired and 334981 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 4.15s, with 990362 rules fired and 402830 states in the queue.
	700000 states explored in 4.43s, with 1156774 rules fired and 468901 states in the queue.
	800000 states explored in 4.72s, with 1322715 rules fired and 535450 states in the queue.
	900000 states explored in 5.05s, with 1489961 rules fired and 600886 states in the queue.
	1000000 states explored in 5.38s, with 1654455 rules fired and 668475 states in the queue.
target state's depth is: 0

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_103" failed.

State Space Explored:

	1037644 states, 1721426 rules fired in 5.52s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
