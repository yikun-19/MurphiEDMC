Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0
Finite-state Concurrent System Verifier.

Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 is based on various versions of Murphi.
Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 :
Copyright (C) 2009-2012 by Sapienza University of Rome.
Murphi release 3.1 :
Copyright (C) 1992 - 1999 by the Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior University.

==========================================================================

Protocol: ./protocols/exec/TL-C_NonIn_S_nodata/TL-C_NonIn_S_nodata_inv207

Algorithm:
	Verification by depth first search.
	with symmetry algorithm 3 -- Heuristic Small Memory Normalization
	with permutation trial limit 10.

Memory usage:

	* The size of each state is 1456 bits (rounded up to 184 bytes).
	* The memory allocated for the hash table and state queue is
	  10485 Mbytes.
	  With two words of overhead per state, the maximum size of
	  the state space is 48366083 states.
	   * Use option "-k" or "-m" to increase this, if necessary.
	* Capacity in queue for depth-first search: 4836608 states.
	   * Change the constant gPercentActiveStates in mu_prolog.inc
	     to increase this, if necessary.

Warning: No trace will not be printed in the case of protocol errors!
         Check the options if you want to have error traces.

Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 4.35s, with 229569 rules fired and 79334 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 5.55s, with 522848 rules fired and 145551 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 6.89s, with 858959 rules fired and 202873 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 8.28s, with 1212914 rules fired and 255756 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 9.72s, with 1591295 rules fired and 305699 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_207" failed.

State Space Explored:

	507129 states, 1619070 rules fired in 9.82s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
