Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0
Finite-state Concurrent System Verifier.

Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 is based on various versions of Murphi.
Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 :
Copyright (C) 2009-2012 by Sapienza University of Rome.
Murphi release 3.1 :
Copyright (C) 1992 - 1999 by the Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior University.

==========================================================================

Protocol: ./protocols/exec/TL-C_In_S_nodata/TL-C_In_S_nodata_inv28

Algorithm:
	Verification by depth first search.
	with symmetry algorithm 3 -- Heuristic Small Memory Normalization
	with permutation trial limit 10.

Memory usage:

	* The size of each state is 1456 bits (rounded up to 184 bytes).
	* The memory allocated for the hash table and state queue is
	  10485 Mbytes.
	  With two words of overhead per state, the maximum size of
	  the state space is 48366083 states.
	   * Use option "-k" or "-m" to increase this, if necessary.
	* Capacity in queue for depth-first search: 4836608 states.
	   * Change the constant gPercentActiveStates in mu_prolog.inc
	     to increase this, if necessary.

Warning: No trace will not be printed in the case of protocol errors!
         Check the options if you want to have error traces.

Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 4.47s, with 306852 rules fired and 51904 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 5.72s, with 654025 rules fired and 97767 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 6.97s, with 1005278 rules fired and 144000 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 8.30s, with 1384591 rules fired and 184104 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 9.61s, with 1762827 rules fired and 226699 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_28" failed.

State Space Explored:

	556991 states, 1971161 rules fired in 10.35s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
