Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0
Finite-state Concurrent System Verifier.

Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 is based on various versions of Murphi.
Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 :
Copyright (C) 2009-2012 by Sapienza University of Rome.
Murphi release 3.1 :

Leland Stanford Junior University.

==========================================================================

Protocol: ./protocols/exec/TL-C_NonIn_S_data/TL-C_NonIn_S_data_inv222

Algorithm:
	Verification by depth first search.
	with symmetry algorithm 3 -- Heuristic Small Memory Normalization
	with permutation trial limit 10.

Memory usage:

	* The size of each state is 1920 bits (rounded up to 240 bytes).
	* The memory allocated for the hash table and state queue is
	  10485 Mbytes.
	  With two words of overhead per state, the maximum size of
	  the state space is 38437547 states.
	   * Use option "-k" or "-m" to increase this, if necessary.
	* Capacity in queue for depth-first search: 3843754 states.
	   * Change the constant gPercentActiveStates in mu_prolog.inc
	     to increase this, if necessary.

Warning: No trace will not be printed in the case of protocol errors!
         Check the options if you want to have error traces.

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_222" failed.

State Space Explored:

	1859587 states, 4391354 rules fired in 27.31s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
