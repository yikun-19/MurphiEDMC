Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0
Finite-state Concurrent System Verifier.

Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 is based on various versions of Murphi.
Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 :
Copyright (C) 2009-2012 by Sapienza University of Rome.
Murphi release 3.1 :
Copyright (C) 1992 - 1999 by the Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior University.

==========================================================================

Protocol: ./protocols/exec/TL-C_NonIn_S_data/TL-C_NonIn_S_data_inv215

Algorithm:
	Verification by depth first search.
	with symmetry algorithm 3 -- Heuristic Small Memory Normalization
	with permutation trial limit 10.

Memory usage:

	* The size of each state is 1920 bits (rounded up to 240 bytes).
	* The memory allocated for the hash table and state queue is
	  10485 Mbytes.
	  With two words of overhead per state, the maximum size of
	  the state space is 38437547 states.
	   * Use option "-k" or "-m" to increase this, if necessary.
	* Capacity in queue for depth-first search: 3843754 states.
	   * Change the constant gPercentActiveStates in mu_prolog.inc
	     to increase this, if necessary.

Warning: No trace will not be printed in the case of protocol errors!
         Check the options if you want to have error traces.

Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 4.24s, with 183389 rules fired and 87581 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 5.25s, with 388837 rules fired and 169198 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 6.28s, with 601527 rules fired and 250672 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 7.36s, with 827591 rules fired and 327935 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 8.42s, with 1046883 rules fired and 408157 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 9.51s, with 1275816 rules fired and 485211 states in the queue.
	700000 states explored in 10.64s, with 1514597 rules fired and 559971 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_215" failed.

State Space Explored:

	709022 states, 1538107 rules fired in 10.75s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
