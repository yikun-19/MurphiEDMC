Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 8.99s, with 377179 rules fired and 80361 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 15.29s, with 811416 rules fired and 159290 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 21.46s, with 1239418 rules fired and 239350 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 27.84s, with 1662669 rules fired and 318130 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 34.28s, with 2095405 rules fired and 397248 states in the queue.

Result:

	Invariant "test_52" failed.

State Space Explored:

	529020 states, 2220581 rules fired in 36.15s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
