Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 10.40s, with 547049 rules fired and 80014 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 16.51s, with 1003860 rules fired and 162634 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_55" failed.

State Space Explored:

	221950 states, 1104140 rules fired in 17.87s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
