Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 5.43s, with 171596 rules fired and 84092 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 7.89s, with 365071 rules fired and 165663 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 10.29s, with 555956 rules fired and 247516 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 12.85s, with 763315 rules fired and 329248 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 15.39s, with 966515 rules fired and 410255 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 18.09s, with 1179001 rules fired and 489342 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_132" failed.

State Space Explored:

	634029 states, 1243922 rules fired in 18.94s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
