Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 5.72s, with 195878 rules fired and 80243 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 8.22s, with 399208 rules fired and 159886 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 10.96s, with 625840 rules fired and 238787 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 13.08s, with 795317 rules fired and 322549 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_217" failed.

State Space Explored:

	434584 states, 858022 rules fired in 13.87s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
