Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 7.61s, with 349291 rules fired and 26252 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 11.53s, with 697599 rules fired and 67354 states in the queue.

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_27" failed.

State Space Explored:

	253561 states, 858798 rules fired in 13.37s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
