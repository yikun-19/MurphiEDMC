	200000 states explored in 7.61s, with 402180 rules fired and 159373 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 10.16s, with 640451 rules fired and 236744 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 12.33s, with 843124 rules fired and 318216 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 14.49s, with 1045446 rules fired and 399328 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 16.93s, with 1270022 rules fired and 477697 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_248" failed.

State Space Explored:

	662843 states, 1402619 rules fired in 18.41s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
