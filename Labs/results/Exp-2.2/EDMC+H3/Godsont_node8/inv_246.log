Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 3.70s, with 113512 rules fired and 85130 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 4.81s, with 228504 rules fired and 170309 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 5.98s, with 343462 rules fired and 254131 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 7.11s, with 459994 rules fired and 337843 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 8.27s, with 575871 rules fired and 422061 states in the queue.
target state's depth is: 24

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_246" failed.

State Space Explored:

	577193 states, 664931 rules fired in 9.16s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
