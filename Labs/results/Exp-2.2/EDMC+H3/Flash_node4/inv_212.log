Protocol: ./protocols/exec/flash4/Flash_node4_inv212
===========================================
  You are using EDMC algorithm.  
===========================================

===== Startstates are generated! =====

Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 3.04s, with 147958 rules fired and 73865 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 3.47s, with 298772 rules fired and 147585 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_212" failed.

State Space Explored:

	267729 states, 399056 rules fired in 3.75s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
