Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 14.90s, with 930931 rules fired and 61778 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 33.89s, with 1964956 rules fired and 93740 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_24" failed.

State Space Explored:

	274096 states, 2570237 rules fired in 45.53s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
