Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 21.45s, with 931943 rules fired and 61584 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 42.77s, with 1966111 rules fired and 94028 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 60.26s, with 2743861 rules fired and 148955 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 86.10s, with 4126444 rules fired and 186365 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 101.84s, with 4787873 rules fired and 239789 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_33" failed.

State Space Explored:

	598535 states, 5600911 rules fired in 113.95s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
