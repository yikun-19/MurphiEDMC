===== Init heuristics! =====

Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 14.84s, with 937440 rules fired and 61284 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_23" failed.

State Space Explored:

	130485 states, 1298596 rules fired in 20.44s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
