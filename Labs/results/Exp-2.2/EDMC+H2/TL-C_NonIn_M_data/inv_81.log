Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 6.80s, with 387342 rules fired and 73721 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 12.55s, with 986601 rules fired and 129949 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 15.08s, with 1240233 rules fired and 209814 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_81" failed.

State Space Explored:

	327925 states, 1325020 rules fired in 15.92s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
