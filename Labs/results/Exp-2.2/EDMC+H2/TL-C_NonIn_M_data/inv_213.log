Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 6.86s, with 314883 rules fired and 78862 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 11.34s, with 685822 rules fired and 151798 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 17.23s, with 1168545 rules fired and 216074 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 22.64s, with 1607689 rules fired and 282568 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 26.41s, with 1906387 rules fired and 358232 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_213" failed.

State Space Explored:

	504005 states, 1915795 rules fired in 26.53s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
