Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 6.24s, with 347964 rules fired and 76205 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 10.64s, with 825453 rules fired and 141232 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 13.05s, with 1078842 rules fired and 221412 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 18.23s, with 1621369 rules fired and 280014 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 23.39s, with 2152609 rules fired and 337658 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_24" failed.

State Space Explored:

	594269 states, 2403754 rules fired in 25.84s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
