Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 6.43s, with 314883 rules fired and 78862 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 10.36s, with 685987 rules fired and 151779 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 15.56s, with 1170323 rules fired and 215941 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 20.30s, with 1608548 rules fired and 282442 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_211" failed.

State Space Explored:

	486525 states, 1875788 rules fired in 23.29s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
