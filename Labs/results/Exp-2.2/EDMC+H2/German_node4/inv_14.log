Protocol: ./protocols/exec/German_node4/German_node4_inv14
===========================================
  You are using EDMC algorithm.  
===========================================

===== Startstates are generated! =====
Carelist Layer 0: Cache[1].State Cache[2].State Cache[3].State Cache[4].State 

===== Init heuristics! =====

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_14" failed.

State Space Explored:

	2553 states, 6071 rules fired in 3.85s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
