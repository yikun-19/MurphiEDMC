Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 7.32s, with 329068 rules fired and 53984 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 11.93s, with 771888 rules fired and 90983 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 16.81s, with 1111658 rules fired and 141400 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 21.77s, with 1445107 rules fired and 193048 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_58" failed.

State Space Explored:

	441333 states, 1612958 rules fired in 24.30s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
