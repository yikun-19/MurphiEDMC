Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 6.91s, with 289722 rules fired and 79916 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 10.00s, with 530455 rules fired and 162445 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_139" failed.

State Space Explored:

	216711 states, 568952 rules fired in 10.49s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
