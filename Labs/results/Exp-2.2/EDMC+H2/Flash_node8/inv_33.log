Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 5.41s, with 290013 rules fired and 79912 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 7.76s, with 529363 rules fired and 162667 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_33" failed.

State Space Explored:

	285328 states, 812437 rules fired in 10.61s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
