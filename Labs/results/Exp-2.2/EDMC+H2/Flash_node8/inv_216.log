Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 7.13s, with 292444 rules fired and 79718 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 10.14s, with 523215 rules fired and 162918 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 14.96s, with 889462 rules fired and 235709 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_216" failed.

State Space Explored:

	307102 states, 916657 rules fired in 15.31s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
