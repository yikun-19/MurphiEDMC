Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 4.85s, with 289319 rules fired and 79957 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 6.72s, with 528379 rules fired and 162658 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_24" failed.

State Space Explored:

	283570 states, 799055 rules fired in 8.88s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
