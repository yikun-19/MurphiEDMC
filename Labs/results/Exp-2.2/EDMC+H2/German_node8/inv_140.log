Protocol: ./protocols/exec/German_node8/German_node8_inv140
===========================================
  You are using EDMC algorithm.  
===========================================

===== Startstates are generated! =====
Carelist Layer 0: Cache[1].State Cache[2].State Cache[3].State Cache[4].State Cache[5].State Cache[6].State Cache[7].State Cache[8].State 

===== Init heuristics! =====

Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 7.78s, with 290285 rules fired and 75255 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_140" failed.

State Space Explored:

	104063 states, 302252 rules fired in 7.89s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
