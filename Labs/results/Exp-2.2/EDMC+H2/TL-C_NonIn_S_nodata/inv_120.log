Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 8.68s, with 376681 rules fired and 45611 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 11.77s, with 712825 rules fired and 97909 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 15.69s, with 1137147 rules fired and 138376 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 19.55s, with 1561617 rules fired and 180262 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_120" failed.

State Space Explored:

	463045 states, 1830083 rules fired in 22.05s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
