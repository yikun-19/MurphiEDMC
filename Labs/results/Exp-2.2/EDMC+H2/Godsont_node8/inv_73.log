	500000 states explored in 11.24s, with 615219 rules fired and 322303 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 13.45s, with 748460 rules fired and 372262 states in the queue.
target state's depth is: 8

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_73" failed.

State Space Explored:

	669998 states, 828736 rules fired in 14.42s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
