	500000 states explored in 11.37s, with 616202 rules fired and 319483 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 13.50s, with 748500 rules fired and 372517 states in the queue.
target state's depth is: 8

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_54" failed.

State Space Explored:

	637723 states, 792154 rules fired in 14.10s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
