	200000 states explored in 49.72s, with 1181614 rules fired and 119536 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 58.39s, with 1901252 rules fired and 170784 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 67.61s, with 2666797 rules fired and 217011 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 77.55s, with 3457199 rules fired and 254819 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 84.89s, with 4054879 rules fired and 311196 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_126" failed.

State Space Explored:

	628969 states, 4188956 rules fired in 86.44s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
