	600000 states explored in 56.59s, with 3578469 rules fired and 363004 states in the queue.
	700000 states explored in 66.53s, with 4407862 rules fired and 397221 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_124" failed.

State Space Explored:

	775060 states, 5099506 rules fired in 75.00s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
