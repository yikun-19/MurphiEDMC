	600000 states explored in 74.84s, with 3577827 rules fired and 360235 states in the queue.
	700000 states explored in 87.45s, with 4337752 rules fired and 403167 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_120" failed.

State Space Explored:

	790944 states, 5179268 rules fired in 101.81s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
