Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 25.90s, with 319694 rules fired and 81386 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 29.70s, with 689554 rules fired and 160974 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 34.01s, with 1105712 rules fired and 238387 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 38.57s, with 1533290 rules fired and 314754 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 44.06s, with 1971519 rules fired and 390687 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_101" failed.

State Space Explored:

	573487 states, 2293922 rules fired in 49.62s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
