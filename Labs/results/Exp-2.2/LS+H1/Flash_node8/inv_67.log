==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_67" failed.

State Space Explored:

	4818025 states, 7482049 rules fired in 103.39s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
