Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 6.10s, with 354895 rules fired and 75877 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 8.81s, with 723562 rules fired and 153381 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 12.16s, with 1164356 rules fired and 225335 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 15.58s, with 1597210 rules fired and 291651 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 19.18s, with 2057303 rules fired and 358199 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 22.66s, with 2505257 rules fired and 428749 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_49" failed.

State Space Explored:

	643184 states, 2710507 rules fired in 24.28s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
