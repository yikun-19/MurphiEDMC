Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 12.14s, with 587411 rules fired and 53984 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 23.46s, with 1321172 rules fired and 90983 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 32.80s, with 1923693 rules fired and 141400 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 41.81s, with 2503938 rules fired and 193048 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_58" failed.

State Space Explored:

	441333 states, 2792682 rules fired in 46.39s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
