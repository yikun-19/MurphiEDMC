Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 7.31s, with 423760 rules fired and 73120 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 11.92s, with 919180 rules fired and 143962 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 16.65s, with 1429612 rules fired and 213423 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 21.75s, with 1988605 rules fired and 280172 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 27.02s, with 2598451 rules fired and 347537 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_133" failed.

State Space Explored:

	540844 states, 2853753 rules fired in 29.30s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
