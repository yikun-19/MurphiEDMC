Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 13.71s, with 568003 rules fired and 60300 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 23.65s, with 1192761 rules fired and 117152 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 31.10s, with 1812458 rules fired and 174526 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 41.32s, with 2466094 rules fired and 230740 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_123" failed.

State Space Explored:

	424936 states, 2620254 rules fired in 44.02s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
