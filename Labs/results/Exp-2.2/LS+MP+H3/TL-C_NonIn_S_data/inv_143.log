	300000 states explored in 21.87s, with 1623575 rules fired and 205890 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 27.89s, with 2201864 rules fired and 274145 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 33.37s, with 2738591 rules fired and 346855 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 39.55s, with 3345403 rules fired and 416230 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_143" failed.

State Space Explored:

	610954 states, 3405903 rules fired in 40.19s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
