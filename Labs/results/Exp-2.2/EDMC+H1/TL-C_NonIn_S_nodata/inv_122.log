Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 4.86s, with 271803 rules fired and 60155 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 7.49s, with 640944 rules fired and 107689 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 10.02s, with 995914 rules fired and 158729 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 12.65s, with 1368990 rules fired and 207706 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 15.88s, with 1842688 rules fired and 246695 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_122" failed.

State Space Explored:

	544821 states, 1986897 rules fired in 17.25s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
