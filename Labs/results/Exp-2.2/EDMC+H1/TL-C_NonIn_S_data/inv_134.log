Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 7.80s, with 324844 rules fired and 39738 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 12.55s, with 697328 rules fired and 81617 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 18.44s, with 1148896 rules fired and 110855 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 29.65s, with 1941981 rules fired and 69504 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_134" failed.

State Space Explored:

	401425 states, 1947115 rules fired in 29.72s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
