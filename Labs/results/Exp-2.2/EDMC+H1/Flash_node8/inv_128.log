Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 5.76s, with 180775 rules fired and 82411 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 7.55s, with 350412 rules fired and 166218 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 9.66s, with 549827 rules fired and 247793 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 11.93s, with 755573 rules fired and 329852 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 14.52s, with 978173 rules fired and 410939 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 17.19s, with 1192681 rules fired and 492044 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_128" failed.

State Space Explored:

	645193 states, 1279264 rules fired in 18.29s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
