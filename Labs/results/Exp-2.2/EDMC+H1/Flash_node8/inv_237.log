Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 5.47s, with 172190 rules fired and 83120 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 7.77s, with 355419 rules fired and 165695 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 10.20s, with 552330 rules fired and 247613 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 12.59s, with 744538 rules fired and 330514 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 15.08s, with 945172 rules fired and 412547 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 17.46s, with 1136946 rules fired and 495335 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_237" failed.

State Space Explored:

	601788 states, 1139865 rules fired in 17.49s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
