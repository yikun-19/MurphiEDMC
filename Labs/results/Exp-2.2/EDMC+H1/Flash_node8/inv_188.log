Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 5.40s, with 209816 rules fired and 78494 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 7.33s, with 396861 rules fired and 159881 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 9.88s, with 641259 rules fired and 235689 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 12.09s, with 857221 rules fired and 316036 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 14.10s, with 1053223 rules fired and 397544 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 15.74s, with 1247625 rules fired and 479218 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_188" failed.

State Space Explored:

	683809 states, 1415025 rules fired in 17.22s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
