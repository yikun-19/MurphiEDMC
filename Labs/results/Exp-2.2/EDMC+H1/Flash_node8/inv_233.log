	300000 states explored in 10.10s, with 611392 rules fired and 239664 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 12.80s, with 850388 rules fired and 317211 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 14.94s, with 1040981 rules fired and 399949 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 17.19s, with 1241162 rules fired and 481763 states in the queue.
	700000 states explored in 20.01s, with 1475688 rules fired and 557532 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_233" failed.

State Space Explored:

	719157 states, 1510794 rules fired in 20.43s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
