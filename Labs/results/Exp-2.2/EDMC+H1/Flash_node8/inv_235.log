	300000 states explored in 11.03s, with 631272 rules fired and 236245 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 13.44s, with 850027 rules fired and 315483 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 16.54s, with 1096430 rules fired and 392401 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 18.98s, with 1318375 rules fired and 471477 states in the queue.
	700000 states explored in 21.51s, with 1509569 rules fired and 552603 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_235" failed.

State Space Explored:

	745773 states, 1605882 rules fired in 22.73s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
