	200000 states explored in 8.39s, with 400497 rules fired and 159778 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 11.21s, with 618706 rules fired and 238506 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 13.68s, with 811749 rules fired and 320796 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 16.32s, with 1017055 rules fired and 401640 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 19.27s, with 1250186 rules fired and 480701 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_108" failed.

State Space Explored:

	644921 states, 1347581 rules fired in 20.53s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
