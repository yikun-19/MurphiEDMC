Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 4.73s, with 201529 rules fired and 79878 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 6.84s, with 455336 rules fired and 156006 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 8.39s, with 637576 rules fired and 238990 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 10.34s, with 864084 rules fired and 317331 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 11.94s, with 1054774 rules fired and 399004 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 13.70s, with 1243845 rules fired and 480172 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_186" failed.

State Space Explored:

	622905 states, 1286095 rules fired in 14.22s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
