Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 5.55s, with 185861 rules fired and 80658 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 8.11s, with 395872 rules fired and 162037 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 11.17s, with 641478 rules fired and 239432 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 13.75s, with 842951 rules fired and 320320 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 16.40s, with 1050986 rules fired and 399400 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_109" failed.

State Space Explored:

	518808 states, 1084966 rules fired in 16.84s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
