Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 4.05s, with 143531 rules fired and 85762 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 5.53s, with 310679 rules fired and 169317 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 6.91s, with 466964 rules fired and 253955 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 8.21s, with 613423 rules fired and 339480 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 9.51s, with 760747 rules fired and 425051 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_6" failed.

State Space Explored:

	589150 states, 903679 rules fired in 10.78s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
