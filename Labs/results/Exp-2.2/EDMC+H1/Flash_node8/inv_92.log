Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 6.08s, with 218254 rules fired and 78281 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 8.48s, with 404140 rules fired and 159309 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 10.35s, with 592069 rules fired and 241132 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 12.34s, with 819552 rules fired and 320559 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 14.37s, with 1053914 rules fired and 399283 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 16.24s, with 1268339 rules fired and 479514 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_92" failed.

State Space Explored:

	636161 states, 1338071 rules fired in 16.86s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
