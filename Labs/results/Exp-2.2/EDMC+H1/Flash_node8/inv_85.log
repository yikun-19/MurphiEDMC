Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 5.96s, with 211960 rules fired and 78757 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 7.66s, with 404803 rules fired and 159156 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 9.29s, with 595669 rules fired and 240811 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 11.14s, with 811456 rules fired and 320531 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 13.04s, with 1035021 rules fired and 399161 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 14.93s, with 1258185 rules fired and 478734 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_85" failed.

State Space Explored:

	664534 states, 1397584 rules fired in 16.14s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
