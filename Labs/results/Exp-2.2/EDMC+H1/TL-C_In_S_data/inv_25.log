Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 5.50s, with 263359 rules fired and 55425 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 8.59s, with 598555 rules fired and 96216 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 11.90s, with 968910 rules fired and 135931 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_25" failed.

State Space Explored:

	330347 states, 1093996 rules fired in 13.03s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
