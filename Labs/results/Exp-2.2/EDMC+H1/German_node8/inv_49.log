	200000 states explored in 6.11s, with 362496 rules fired and 153381 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 7.87s, with 583824 rules fired and 225335 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 9.69s, with 804074 rules fired and 291651 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 11.60s, with 1039975 rules fired and 358199 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 13.48s, with 1268402 rules fired and 428749 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_49" failed.

State Space Explored:

	643184 states, 1373968 rules fired in 14.35s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
