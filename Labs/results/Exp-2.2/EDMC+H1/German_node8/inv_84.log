Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 5.24s, with 231705 rules fired and 59824 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 7.68s, with 533387 rules fired and 108200 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 10.01s, with 813068 rules fired and 161704 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 12.96s, with 1176148 rules fired and 208814 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 15.77s, with 1513841 rules fired and 258220 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_84" failed.

State Space Explored:

	529429 states, 1585908 rules fired in 16.38s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
